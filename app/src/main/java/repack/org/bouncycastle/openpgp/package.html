High level classes for dealing with OpenPGP objects.
<p>
<b>Note</b>: These are based on the org.bouncycastle.bcpg classes and use a streaming
model, so for some objects which have an input stream associated it is necessary
to read to the end of the input stream on the object before trying to read
another object from the orginal input stream.
<p>
A word on key ring files. For the purpose of this package a PGP key ring is a master key and
a collection of sub-keys associated with it. These public and secret key rings are handled by
the PGPPublicKey ring class and the PGPSecretKeyRing class respectively. In the case where
you are trying to read an key file which has multiple key rings in it, use PGPSecretKeyRingCollection
for the secret key file and PGPPublicKeyRingCollection for the public key file.
